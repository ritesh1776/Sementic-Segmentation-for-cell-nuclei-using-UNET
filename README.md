# Sementic-Segmentation-for-cell-nuclei-using-UNET
U-Net, conceived by Ronnenberg (2015), stands as a masterpiece in the art of
modeling for image segmentation. Its distinctive contracting-expansive path and
incorporation of skip connections address challenges related to object boundary
delineation. This architecture has become a cornerstone in biomedical image
analysis, illustrating the significance of thoughtful design in achieving precise
segmentation.
The U-Net architecture exhibited superior recall in cell nuclei segmentation, with
an accuracy of 96.33%. The design of U-Net, incorporating skip connections to
preserve fine-grained details, contributed to its efficacy in accurately delineating
cell nuclei boundaries. Visual examination of the segmentation outputs revealed
precise localization and high conformity with ground truth annotations.
